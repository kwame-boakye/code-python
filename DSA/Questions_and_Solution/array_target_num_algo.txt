Problem:
Given any array of integers and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target integer

Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Get the array of numbers
3. Get the target number
4. Create an empty array to store the indices
5. Starting from the first number in the array, add it to the other numbers to see if it will add up to the target number
6. Skip any number that is greater than the target number
7. Repeat step 5 if unsuccessful, this time starting from the next number less than the target number
8. Place the two numbers you got in an array and display them
9. Stop
