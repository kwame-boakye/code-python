Problem: Write a function that checks if one list is a subset of another. Given two lists, list1 and list2, determine if all elements of list1 are contained in list2

Algorithm
1. Start
2. Get list 1
3. Get list 2
4. Define a function to check whether the second list (members) are in the parent list
5. If all the members are in the parent list, return True. Also return True if the second list is an empty list.
6. Stop
