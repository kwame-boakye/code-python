Problem: Given a string, find the first character that appears only once. If there is no such character, return None

Example:
Input - "swiss"
Output - "w"

Input - "aabbcc"
Output - None

Algorithm
1. Start
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the character frequencies
3. Convert the input sting to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity
4. Count occurrences of each character in the string
5. Find the first non-repeating number
6. If non-repeating character is found, print an appropriate message
7. Stop
